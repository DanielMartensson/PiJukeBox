# PiJukeBox

This is a simple project where I use Java and Pi4J to turn an old Centrum U68 from 1940 into a MP3 player. 
The reason is because short wave, middle wave and long wave is today obsolete and not being used or sended today
in Sweden. Also the electronics inside was a mess and very dangerous because it runs on both AC/DC current and all the
wires is begun to lose its isolators. 

So I installed a Raspberry Pi B+ and OpenJDK 8 and Pi4J inside this radio and then it become a juke box.
